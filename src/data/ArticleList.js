        body: [`Every culture around the globe creates mythical tales. And a lot of them involve scary creatures: Scotland's Loch Ness Monster, for instance or the Himalayans' Yeti, or Abominable Snowman. It's part of our human DNA.
        But why is that? "We tell ourselves stories because we (humans) are storytelling animals," said Shira Chess, assistant mass media professor at the University of Georgia in a Washington Post article. "And, to that end, horror stories take on a specific significance and importance because they function metaphorically — the horror stories that are the best are often metaphors for other issues that affect our lives on both cultural and personal levels."
        America is no exception to the horror story genre. There is a rich trove of tales thanks to Native American folklore coupled with that of ensuing immigrants. Many of the stories were created long ago, when presumably a lack of education, mass communication and critical thinking made such fables easier to believe. However, a surprising number have fairly recent origins, and don't seem to be going away. One on our list even began in the Internet Age. How many of these 10 monsters have you heard of – and do you believe in?

        `10: Bigfoot`,
        `
        Canadians call him Sasquatch. Americans prefer Bigfoot. No matter: All monikers refer to a giant, hairy, ape-man who supposedly has been wandering around North America for at least a century. Most sightings have been in the Pacific Northwest, but there have been Bigfoot reports from nearly every state and Canadian province. (You can check the locations on this handy map).
        Although sightings were reported as far back as 1886, and possibly earlier, Bigfoot really established a toe-hold in North American culture in the latter half of the 20th century, when an article ran in the December 1959 issue of True magazine detailing the discovery of large, mysterious footprints in California. Soon people were producing everything from hair and blood samples to grainy photos and, yes, more footprints which they claimed proved the shaggy creature's existence [sources: Bigfoot Encounters, Radford].
        North Americans aren't alone in their Bigfoot fanaticism; many cultures around the globe have stories about strange ape-like creatures mysteriously walking around. But who really believes in Sasquatch? According to a 2012 Angus Reid survey, a full 29 percent of Americans and 21 percent of Canadians do. That's almost more intriguing than the beast himself.

        `9: Chupacabra`,
        `
        It wanders around attacking livestock, namely goats, then sucking out all of the blood. It's mangy. Deranged. And clearly vicious. It's a chupacabra (choo puh KAH bruh), the Spanish word for "goat sucker." Seeds for the creature's existence were planted in 1970s Puerto Rico, when a rash of farm animals and pets inexplicably died.
        People began whispering that the deaths came at the paws of a mad animal. Fast-forward to the mid-1990s, when a Puerto Rican woman reported seeing a monstrous being near her home. Although she described a red-eyed alien-type figure covered in spikes (and had just seen the movie "Species" featuring a similar being),the creature was dubbed a "chupacabra" and described as an animalistic figure. The legend exploded around the tiny island and across the U.S., becoming an especially popular tale in the Southwest [source: Ross].
        Some said the beast was spawned from a failed NASA experiment; others claimed that the disease AIDS originated in the chupacabra [source: Ross]. One Texas woman even brought in a strange-looking dead critter – a suspected chupacabra – to scientists at Texas State University-San Marcos and the University of California-Davis for DNA testing. Unfortunately for her bragging rights, the results said it was a coyote-Mexican wolf hybrid [source: Radford]. Maybe next time.

        `8: The Jersey Devil (aka Leeds Devil)`,
        `
        How can you not love a story about the spawn of Satan? This myth says that in the 1700s, a woman in New Jersey's Pine Barrens area had 13 children, the last of whom was a devil who flew out the chimney and disappeared shortly after birth. There are several variations to the story, including one where the woman cursed her unborn child by invoking Satan (she wasn't too happy to be pregnant again).
        No matter the exact scenario, the Jersey Devil is depicted as having a horse head, bat-like wings and claws – although it's rarely seen. Instead, it makes its presence known via eerie wailing, awful cries and rampaging sounds throughout the forests of the Pine Barrens area. One notable sighting came in 1909, when Trenton councilman E.P. Weeden reported being awakened in the night by flapping wings outside his bedroom window; in the morning he found cloven prints stamped into the snow. As soon as the news broke, hundreds of people suddenly claimed they, too, had spotted the Jersey Devil [source: The New Jersey Historical Society].
        So how did this story arise? It likely had its origins with one Daniel Leeds of 18th-century New Jersey. A former Quaker, Leeds publicly butted heads with Quaker leaders on religion, occultism and politics for years. When stories of the Jersey Devil arose, it was said to be the child of a Mother Leeds and looked much like the winged dragons on the Leeds family crest [source: Regal].

        `7: Mothman`,
        `
        Driving home late on the night of Nov. 15, 1966, four young adults noticed two red lights in the shadows of the West Virginia Ordnance Works, a former TNT factory from the World War II era. Stopping to investigate, they claim to have discovered a 6- or 7-foot (1.8 or 2 meters)-tall creature that resembled a man with large wings. The two red lights they'd noticed were its eyes. As they raced home in their car, the beast flew after them. Once the news got out, more than 100 people in the Point Pleasant, West Virginia region reported seeing "Mothman" over the next year [source: History]. (Interestingly, a 1966 Associated Press article quotes a West Virginia professor as saying that what the people actually saw was a rare species of crane which had wandered out of its normal migration route.)
        On Dec. 15, 1967, a major bridge in the area collapsed during rush hour, killing 46. The sightings abruptly stopped, leading locals to think that Mothman had been trying to warn them – or was responsible for the tragedy. However, Mothman sightings subsequently cropped up around the globe. While no photos of him exist, reports consistently place him at around 7 feet tall with piercing red eyes (sometimes on his head, other times on his chest) and either bat-like or feathered wings. Point Pleasant, meanwhile, embraced its moment in the spotlight, erecting a Mothman statue and creating the Mothman Museum and Mothman Festival.

        `6: Wendigo`,
        `
        The story of the Wendigo comes from Native American folklore and is linked with cannibalism. The creature, which tends to be found in Northern Minnesota and Canadian forests, is typically described as a 15-foot (4.5-meter) tall man-beast with large eyes and claws, an emaciated frame and an insatiable appetite for human flesh.
        Many Native Americans and white settlers spoke of the Wendigo, blaming it when friends or family members went into the forest and mysteriously disappeared. Another tale says the Wendigo, also called Windigo, isn't a creature, but instead is a cannibalistic spirit that possesses people. In this myth, if a Wendigo possesses you, you'll go out and start eating people. Such was supposedly the case with Swift Runner, a Native American. In 1879, he killed and then ate his entire family. Before the noose was slipped around his neck, he claimed it wasn't his fault – a Wendigo had gotten inside of him and made him do it. He was hanged anyway.

        5: La Llorona`,
        `
        Oh, La Llorona! This tragic figure dressed in white wails along riverbanks, mainly in the Southwest U.S., mourning her two young sons – who she killed. Yikes. According to this popular Hispanic tale, a woman named Maria is La Llorona, which means "the weeping woman" in Spanish. She was a beautiful girl who would only deign to marry the most handsome man. She found and snagged him, and they had two wonderful sons. The couple was very happy. But then Maria's husband began staying away from home for extended periods, drinking excessively and seeing other woman. When he did come home, he only wanted to visit his sons. Enraged and jealous, Maria threw the boys into the river and they drowned.
        Another version of the story says Maria was the wild one, going out at night to entertain men and often leaving her young boys home alone. One night, by themselves once again, they wandered down to the river and drowned. Both versions say that Maria became consumed with guilt and sorrow after the boys' deaths, and began walking alongside the river crying out for them. After she died (either by drowning herself in the same river or wasting away), her ghost continued the ritual, with one ugly twist. Besides mourning her sons along the riverbank, La Llorona would murder whoever crossed her path. The tale is often used by parents to scare their young kids away from dangerous rivers [sources: Hayes, Weiser].

        4: Florida Skunk Ape`,
        `
        Often called the Southernmost Bigfoot, the Florida Skunk Ape is described as a large, hairy ape-man that gives off a horrendous smell and roams around the state of Florida. Numerous sightings have been reported over the years, with the beast showing up in the day and at night, and in all sorts of environments, although it appears to favor swampy areas [source: Florida Skunk Ape].
        Much like Bigfoot, the evidence collected over time consists of photos, hair samples and a few foot casts. (The Skunk Ape apparently has four toes unlike Bigfoot, which has five.) A website devoted to the creature, The Florida Skunk Ape, says it receives several reports of sightings each week. Swamp creatures have long been part of human folklore, so it's probably not surprising that a state with vast tracts of swampland birthed such a myth.

        `
        3: Donkey Lady`,
        `
        If you live in San Antonio, Texas, the Donkey Lady might get you. According to the legend, back in the 1950s there was a terrible house fire in San Antonio. Two children died, and their mother was horribly burned. All of her fingers and toes were gone, leaving hoof-like stumps on her hands and feet. Her face was a charred, unrecognizable mass of flesh. Driven insane by her tragedy, she began to roam the county and terrorize anyone who drew too near. Another version of the tale says she lives under an old stone bridge crossing Elm Creek in south San Antonio. The bridge became dubbed the Donkey Lady Bridge; honk three times if you want her to come out [source: Weird US].
        Some believe that the legend got conflated with a real-life eccentric old lady named Doc Anderson who was known as the Donkey Lady because she lived in shack by a road and took care of donkeys. During the 1970s, people would report seeing a strangely dressed woman popping out of the woods, leading some donkeys to water [source: McCullough].

        2: Wampus Cat`,
        `
        It smells awful, like skunk spray and wet dog. It has glowing yellow eyes and fangs. It kills animals, kidnaps kids and terrifies all it meets. Creepiest of all, it's half-cat, half-woman. This terrifying creature is the Wampus Cat. Generally on the prowl in northeastern Tennessee, the creature has also been spotted in eastern Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia and, intriguingly, at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville.
        Some claim it lives in Knoxville's fetid sewers. Despite innumerable reported sightings, no photos of the creature exist. There are several stories about how the Wampus Cat came to be. Here are two. One says a Cherokee wife hid beneath the skin of a mountain lion to spy on her husband and his buddies while they were hunting. They discovered her and, as punishment, the tribe's medicine man said she had to wear the lion's skin forevermore, turning her into a cat-woman. Anguished, she roams around bemoaning her fate. Another tale says a Cherokee warrior went on the hunt for a beast that was terrorizing his tribe. When he tracked it down, it looked him straight in the eye, causing the warrior to go insane. The warrior's wife wasn't happy about this, so she hid under the skin of a mountain lion and stalked the beast to exact revenge. When she found it, the beast took one look at her and fled, petrified. To this day, the woman's spirit still wanders the area, dressed as a mountain lion [source: Pickens].

        1: Slenderman`,
        `
        Slenderman is a notable legendary figure for two main reasons. He's the world's first mythical creature spawned on the Internet, and there's no question as to whether or not he really exists. Slenderman was created by Floridian Eric Knudsen in 2009 on the Something Awful web forum, where people doctor photos and then write stories about them. Knudsen's photo depicted a tall, willowy, fuzzy figure. He didn't initially write much about it, but hinted at its evil character.
        Fellow forum posters added details, as did Knudsen. Over time Slenderman spread onto other forums and his description began to morph. Sometimes he had multiple arms, other times none. Sometimes he killed his victims, other times his followers killed people for him. Often, you never knew what happened when he caught someone – just that it likely wasn't pretty. Although Knudsen eventually stopped developing the Slenderman character, it lives on through the Internet and its fans, many of whom are teenagers. Tragically, in 2014 two 12-year-old girls almost killed a friend by stabbing her 19 times, in the hopes of pleasing Slenderman, who they thought was real [sources: Biggs, Dewey]. That's the most terrifying Slenderman story of all.",`

        1: Black Annis - England`,
        `
        This is England’s version of the boogeyman. This blue faced witch lives within caves, she has claws made out of iron, razor like teeth, and is often blamed for the disappearances of live stock. She was given the nick name boogeyman of England because it is said she steals children and devours them alive. Parents often tell their children that if they misbehave she’ll come and drag them out of their beds.

        2 : Demagorgon - Greece`,
        `
        Everyone love’s Greek mythology, but have you ever heard of this ancient deity? This monster resides in the underworld, but every year during Hallow's Eve when the portal between the underworld and ours opens it comes out and hunt’s down anything it see’s move, ripping off limbs until there is nothing left of it’s victims body.
        `,
        `
        3 : Dullahan - Ireland`,
        `
        This is a fairy creature, but not the kind you see in Disney movies. It rides a horse at night and carries it’s own head in one arm. It even rips out it’s own spine to lash at it’s victims with. There’s a myth that if it calls out your name you fall dead, unless your carrying gold.
        `,
        `
        4 : Ghoul - Arabia`,
        `
        This monster resembles an evil spirit. It lurks around grave yards and abandoned buildings waiting for victims to pass by. Once it has set it’s target it will sometimes shape shift into a hyena, however this creature prefers to jump right on to whoever's poor soul it stumbles upon and devour their flesh until there's nothing left.
        `,
        `
        5 : Joroguma - China`,
        `
        Scared of spiders? This creature resembles a giant spider, that often shapeshifts into the form of a woman. It tends to lure people into it’s killing grounds and then it exposes it’s true form. This creature uses all of its legs to slash and grab it's target, and uses its sharp teeth to bite into it's victims flesh.
        `,
        `
        6 : Wendigo - Algonquian`,
        `
        According to urban legend, these creatures where once people. It’s believed that when they where human their evil ways turned them into monsters. They’re known to stalk travelers, possess your friends, and are cannibals. Imagine being on a camping trip with your friends and waking up in the middle of the night only to find them eating each other.

        `
        7 : Ink Anymba - South Africa`,
        `
        This one comes from stories passed down by generations of sailors. It takes the form of a giant winged eel, and is often blamed for bad weather. Now it wouldn’t seem so bad if it stopped there, but it enjoys attacking boats, sinking them, and then devouring the ship’s crew.

        Imagine the joy of having a small child grow inside you, now imagine a monster devouring your child from your very womb. This creature is more twisted then most of the creatures I’ve learned about. It possesses pregnant woman and then consumes there unborn babies. Legend say’s the only way to spot that your possessed by one is to look for an upside down reflection of the creature in your eyes.

It is believed that it’s origin came about by the death’s of people who have starved. The bodies of these people collect together after their deaths and create a giant skeleton that lurks across the land.

        userID: 3,
        date: "2021-10-15",
        body: [`Monster comes from the Latin monstrum, meaning something unnatural or unpleasant. Early thinkers thought a monster was some malfunction of nature. There are plenty of monsters in classical mythology. For example, Cerberus is a three-headed dog with a serpent for a tail. Called “the hound of Hades,” Cerberus guards the gates of the underworld to keep the dead from leaving. A serpentine water monster, the multi-headed hydra poses a unique problem as it regenerates two (or more heads) for every head severed making it difficult to kill. Medusa, a gorgon, has wings and venomous snakes in place of hair. Looking at her directly turns the viewer to stone.
        `,
        `Of course, monsters are not found only in times past; we can find plenty of them in the modern era as well. Frankenstein’s Monster or the Creature comes from Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus written in 1818 by Mary Shelley. The novel details Victor Frankenstein’s assembling and animation of a person from various body parts of deceased persons. King Kong, the gigantic ape, first appears in the 1933 movie of the same name. In 1954 Godzilla debuts as an enormous prehistoric sea monster.
        `,
        `There are also friendly monsters such as the Assyrian lumasi (singular lamassu), protective deities with a human head, the body of a bull or a lion, and bird’s wings that originate from the ancient Mesopotamian religion. Moving to the twentieth century we find Chewbacca, the tall, shaggy Wookie from Stars Wars (modeled on director George Lucas’ dog), Cookie Monster from Sesame Street, and the Iron Giant from the 1999 film of the same name.
        `,
        `While the softer monsters may delight us, the scarier monsters are the ones we should pay more attention to. They are the embodiments of our fears, concerns, and anxieties, urgent messengers from the depths of the mind. In fact, Sigmund Freud argued that the monsters in our dreams are created by our unconscious mind and reflect our current worries and fears—even those we fail to consciously acknowledge. Returning to classical myth, the three heads of the Cerberus are symbols. Some think the heads symbolize three kinds of human hatred, three kinds of human greed, or the three stages of the human life cycle. The hydra with its multiplying heads represents futile attempts to solve a problem that results, ironically, in increasing it exponentially. Medusa demonstrates the difficulty, perhaps even fatality, of directly confronting and addressing a problem that one is not yet prepared or equipped to process.
        `,
        `Moving forward to the modern, many of our monsters point to an unsure relationship with technology, nature, and/or science. Frankenstein’s Monster is an allegory for experimenting with unknown sciences and forces, creating something with the capacity for killing, and being unable to stop or recall it. It is not a coincidence that Shelley gave the novel the subtitle The Modern Prometheus. Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity. In this same sense, Victor Frankenstein steals the spark of life reserved for the sacred realm and brings it to the realm of the profane. It was an unnatural creation of life that had a monstrous result. Such an act violates a basic contract with the universe and brings up questions in areas such as medicine, resuscitation, brain/body death, and the right to die. Although scientists today have codes of conduct in regards to the experiments they conduct, many still fear there is a cost to pursuing certain types of knowledge. Similarly, King Kong taps into longstanding fears of being overwhelmed by the natural world and the various creatures within—The Planet of the Apes series delves into a lot of this subject matter, too. Psychologists worry that with our increased dependence on technology and a decrease in the amount of time we spend outdoors our fears of the natural world will only increase.
        `,
        `Godzilla takes it a step further by adding a nuclear element. First appearing in 1954’s Godzilla, Godzilla is awakened and strengthened by nuclear power. Considering that the film is Japanese and that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki occurred less than a decade before Godzilla’s debut, the connections between nuclear force and Godzilla are clear. Other mythological sea beasts have connections to modern technologies. The kraken is a legendary sea monster, akin to a giant squid. For early sailors, it was probably an exaggeration of something they actually saw or heard of. However, the kraken has also come to symbolize a huge, unseen force waiting beneath the surface to erupt, much like a nuclear weapon, and devastate us. Consider these lines of description from Lord Alfred Tennyson’s “The Kraken.” He “will lie / until the latter fire shall heat the deep / Then once by man and angels to be seen, / In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.” Though it was written in 1830 and so Tennyson most likely was not thinking specifically of nuclear force, the poem sounds eerily like a narrative of a nuclear weapon waiting in a silo to be launched and lay waste to the world.
        `,
        `Monsters frighten us—whether they are the monsters from nature or the monsters we have created. Nonetheless, we must not look away because the most effective way to deal with a monster is to confront it. Another root word contained within monster is the Latin monstrare meaning to show or demonstrate. Monsters are trying to show us something important. Monsters are masks for what we really fear.`,

        `Regardless of their different sizes, features, and forms, monsters have one trait in common — they eat humans. Whatever else they may do for us psychologically, monsters express — and ex-press — our dread of being torn apart, eviscerated, chewed, swallowed, and then shit out. This shameful fate of those who are eaten is confronted in an African myth in which a giant predatory bird swallows the hero whole day after day and then excretes him. Myth after myth confronts the stark facts of being consumed by a larger creature, obsessively depicting in graphic detail what both monsters and animal predators naturally do — turn humans into excrement.
        `,
        `Every day over the course of several million years, our ancestors saw (and heard) living creatures being torn apart and devoured by hungry animals — with some victims still kicking as they were eviscerated and dismembered. No wonder our brains are wired to make us dread this awful fate, and that the stories we tell ourselves reflect this dread and attempt to express it — press it out.

        `The archetype of the monster is an expression of this primal fear writ large, exaggerated and intensified to an outlandish degree. But why does this primal fear take the form of a “monster,” that is, a predatory creature that grotesquely mixes animal or human-and-animal physical features? In what way did our experiences as a prey species contribute to the formation of the mythic monster ?
        `,
        `Let’s begin by looking at the most widespread and celebrated of all mythic monsters — the dragon. This creature, in one guise or another, appears in almost every mythology and has been the subject of many books and countless articles. Perhaps the most intriguing of these examinations is "An Instinct for Dragons" by anthropologist David E. Jones. Jones argues that the image of the dragon is composed of the salient body parts of three predator species that hunted and killed our tree-dwelling African primate ancestors for about sixty million years. The three predators are the leopard, the python, and the eagle.
        `,
        `According to Jones (what follows is a condensed summary of a complex argument), ancient primates evolved alarm calls to identify each of the three predators, with each call triggering the defensive response appropriate to the nature of the attack mode of the specific predator. Jones calls this predator-recognition template the “snake/raptor/cat complex.” This complex is the source of what Jones refers to as the “ brain dragon.” The brain dragon emerged when our apelike ancestors left the trees to walk on the ground. rather suddenly, the relatively small brain of Australopithecus had to process a lot of information about many new forms of predators and develop new alarms calls and strategic responses to them. Faced with information overload, the brain of Australopithecus resorted to lumping information into manageable and memorable chunks. As a result, the cat, the snake, and the raptor were merged into a hybrid creature that had the salient predatory features of each: the face of a feline, the body of a snake, and the talons of a raptor. This is the hybrid “monster” that came to be known as the “dragon.”

        `Because the image combined features from three dominant predators, it could quickly send the neural message very dangerous animal. Indeed, the derivation of the word monster seems to acknowledge this ancient function. Monster comes from the Latin word monstrare, “to show,” and monere, “to warn.” Monsters are warning signs, reminding us of the many threatening creatures lurking in the environment eager to gobble us up.
        `,
        `Jones argues that the image of the dragon—the salient elements of which were already hardwired into the primate brain—became a “pattern” or “template” that could be passed on genetically as well as culturally. He spends a considerable amount of space demonstrating how this process could have worked, but the upshot is that the “ brain-dragon” was stored in the human mind for hundreds of thousands of years, where it lay dormant or lurked in the dreams of ancient humans, to be released during times of great communal anxiety. It was only with the development of language and art, Jones argues, that the image of the dragon could be given full expression and a greater semblance of reality. It could be said, then, that the dragon — like other monsters and mythic figures — is a product of the cognitive fluidity that underlies the mythic imagination. The archetype of the dragon gave form to the fears engendered by humanity’s developing ability to imagine all kinds of new dangers and threats.
        `,
        `Jones’s notion that the dragon is composed of tissue samples taken from real predators could account, as well, for the origin of other mythic monsters. The shape of the snake, for example, could furnish not only the body of the mythic dragon but the neck of the hydra; the beak of the raptor could replace the face of the big cat and also be combined with its paws. For example, the griffin has the body parts of a lion but the face and wings of an eagle. And so on. Whatever the particular form the monster may have taken within a specific geographical area, its essential features would clearly have identified it as a very dangerous creature even to those unfamiliar with local fauna. Monsters were used as a means of imbuing sacred or dangerous geographical areas with taboo and explaining the source and cause of lethal natural disasters, such as typhoons, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and so on. But the basic function of the monster was to give fear a face, to graphically capture the dread that is bred into us by millions of years as a prey species that was stalked and sometimes eaten by huge and terrifying carnivores.
        `,
        `The “monsters” of the mythic imagination also inherited some of their DNA from the very real “monsters” created by Mother Nature herself. In ancient Australia (and perhaps in other areas of the Southeast), there was a flesh- eating lizard measuring up to thirty feet long and weighing two thousand pounds, almost “ten times the weight of its closest relative the ‘ora’ or Komodo dragon.” There were birds too huge to fly, four-legged animals that could walk at times on two legs, and carnivores that possessed both female and male genitals (as does the female hyena). In the nineteenth century, monster-lore scholar Charles Gould suggested that some monsters may reflect cultural memories of “a few cretaceous and early tertiary forms” that were thought to have gone extinct but that “struggled on” in isolated and remote areas of the world. This same claim is made today by some cryptozoologists.
        `,
        `Another fertile source of mythic monsters is the bone yard. It’s long been noted that the fossilized skeletons of long-extinct creatures from the age of dinosaurs contributed to the creation of mythic monsters. It was as far back as 1831 that Gould suggested that belief in monsters arose from the frequent discoveries of the remains of “monstrous amphibians.” Gould also pointed out that when the Chinese came across the skeletons of long-extinct dinosaurs, they referred to them as “dragon bones.” In the Carpathians, the bones of extinct cave bears also have been interpreted as the remains of dragons. The reptilian or serpentine characteristics given to many mythic monsters may reflect the fact that fossilized skeletons, often reduced to an undulating backbone and neck, look like a snake. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, a decomposed human backbone transforms into a snake, a literal and figurative example of the mythologizing process I’m describing.
        `,
        `No one has done more to illuminate the relationship between fossils and mythmaking than Adrienne Mayor, who has documented hundreds of instances during the last two thousand five hundred years when fossil bones provided the scaffolding for elaborate mythmaking, as frightened people sought to give meaning to the startling animal remains they happened across. To cite just one example, the Thunder Bird of Native American mythology may have something to do with discoveries of Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons. “Someone who discovered a tyrannosaurid forelimb with its peculiar pair of claws, and perhaps with the elongated, birdlike shoulderblade, might well have identified the fossil as part of the skeleton of some mysterious bird.”
        `,
        `The mythologizing process probably did not start with the Greeks and Romans or even with the appearance of the modern brain. Homo erectus also must have tried to explain the frightful skulls and bones it came across. These remains must have been particularly terrifying since early humans could not have known that the remains belonged to carnivorous “monsters” long extinct. In fact, the hyper predator detection system of early humans would have prompted them to interpret the bones as the remains of creatures still alive and possibly lurking somewhere in the environment. The tens of millions of bones that accumulated ever since the first skeletal creatures swam in the sea provided our forebears with constant provocations to imagine the existence of monstrous predators.
        `,
        `Monsters were also created by dreams and reveries. According to medical anthropologist Alondra Oubre, “proto-humans” of the Early Pleistocene first discovered the emotional and psychological rewards of altering the normal chemistry of the brain. These altered states of consciousness enabled our ancestors to “unlock the doors” to the unconscious and to access its “unlimited reservoir of fantasia, hypnagogic imagery, day-dreaming, and creative ideation.” These counter-factual and counter-intuitive images and symbols were fabricated, necessarily, from the bits and pieces of daily life. The memories of these experiences were not stored as accurate snapshots but as somewhat distorted versions of that experience, reshaped, exaggerated, or diminished according to their emotional content. Oubre suggests that early humans engaged in these practices to escape their “anguishing existence in a prey-versus-predator world.” Admittedly, it would have been suicidal to “escape” from this world for too long or too often—to lose touch with the real threats that provoked the anxieties in the first place. But periodic escape, during rituals, would have been therapeutic, helping assuage fear and increase confidence.
        `,
        `These fear-management strategies, however, had ironic consequences. Among the salient experiences our ancient ancestors remembered and stored in their unconscious must have been life-threatening encounters with predators. Which means that during altered states, images of predators would have undergone further shaping, twisting, recombination, or hybridization. The upshot is that proto-humans were able to conjure up hybrid images of animals well before cognitive fluidity and mythmaking emerged during the Middle Paleolithic.
        `,
        `Although proto-humans could not spin yarns about monsters, they may have been able to imagine them, and thus unintentionally add to their fears through the same processes they were using to escape their fears. Obviously we cannot know what proto-humans envisioned during consciousness-altering rituals, but we do know that during such states, humans with modern brains envision monsters. In several Native American cultures, visions often entail an encounter with powerful animal spirits.
        `,
        `Mythic monsters are often explained — or explained away — as symbols of the “monster within,” an embodiment or projection of the greedy, aggressive impulses at the core of what Jung called the Shadow aspects of the “self and the psyche that are disowned and repressed because they are considered to be bad and evil.” That Shadow wants to feel “the thrill of fangs and claws, the thrill of copulation without commitment, the dog within going wild after a lifetime on the leash.” Monsters allow us to express and confront our dark unconscious, enabling it to materialize — and by so doing , exorcize — hidden and repressed desires and fears.
        `,
        `It can hardly be doubted that monsters “materialize real desires and fears,” but what desires and fears ? How did the monster get inside us in the first place ?
        `,
        `One answer is to say that the “monster” was always in us, as part of our primate inheritance — the “killer ape” view. Faced with so many environmental threats, early humans had to band together in collective group defense rather than kill and eat each other, a task already performed so well by predators. No doubt within the group there was jostling for status and goods, but intra-group and inter-group homicide was probably very rare, or we would not be here to speculate about it. It took a very long time for humans to be transformed — indeed to transform themselves — into the alpha predator of the planet. We were not born “monsters,” we became “monsters.”
        `,
        `This transformation was accomplished, I suggest, through mimesis. We became efficient killers by watching and imitating efficient killers — which is to say that we “performed the predator” in more ways than one. Our ancestors studied predators, learned how to “read their minds” in order to predict their behavior, imitated their hunting behaviors and tactics in ritual and in the hunt, and eventually used the teeth and bones of predators to make weapons. Those who could most successfully imitate the hunting behaviors of predators had a better chance of surviving and passing on their genetic material than those who couldn’t. Over a considerable period of time, mimesis managed to transform the Homo line into a species able — and sometimes eager — to kill vast numbers of its own kind with such up-close-and-personal weapons as bare hands, stones, knives, scythes, machetes, and garden hoes.
        `,
        `But once again, an irony lurks in this dynamic. It was by imitating and gradually internalizing the tactics and behaviors of predators that we managed to survive the Pleistocene. Given this reality, it would be (and it would have been) suicidal for us to “express” all of the monster within, to rid ourselves of the atavistic, primal, bestial power we’ve inherited or borrowed from predators. At times, to survive, we need to conjure up the monster to combat the monster (as "Alien," "The Edge," "Beowulf," "Predator," "While She Was Out," and so many other survival films dramatize). So it is too simple, and wrong, to dismiss the monster as merely a negative projection of the “bad” or “evil” self, as is so often done. We want and need to feel there’s a monster within us so we can summon its power when necessary. Millions of years as a prey species have taught us that, at times, we must drink the dragon’s blood to survive.

        body: [`The definition of a monster differs depending on who the reader or observer is. A zombie in a TV show may be a scary monster to some, but for others, the scariest monsters are more psychological. Monster design can follow a familiar mythological creature trope, like a vampire or werewolf, or it can be a personal horror all your own.
        `,
        `What Are the Characteristics of a Monster?
        `,
        `The word ‘monster’ stirs up various ideas of traits and psychological aspects of creepy creatures people fear, but there are a number of ways monsters can be portrayed:
        `,
        `Physical characteristics. Monsters can be massive and powerful, like King Kong or Mothra. It can have slimy body parts, rows of sharp teeth, tentacles, a coat of thick armor, or be a completely small and unassuming sort of thing. The physical characteristics of your monster aren’t just for effect, either. Your monster character design should make sense with the background you’ve provided. For example, if it has wings, it should use them to fly. Monsters aren’t decorative—they're reflections of peoples’ deepest rooted fears.
        `,
        `Psychological traits. Some believe that the true monsters are the ones that lurk inside our own minds. Monsters can scare us when they play into phobias, like Pennywise from Stephen King’s It (1986), who appeared as a vicious clown but also took the form of the main characters’ greatest fears. Monsters can also be symbolic or emotional manifestations. Sometimes monsters don’t need to interact with the characters at all—the characters build the fear around the idea of the monster themselves—which can amplify the terror that readers and viewers feel along with them.
        `,
        `Who it targets. Does it feed on children? Is it attracted to despair? Does it get violent at the scent of blood? What triggers your monster? When does it appear, and why? Knowing what motivates your monster is the key to figuring out why it behaves the way it does and creates a sense of understanding for your audience.
        `,
        `What it’s weak to. Is there anything that can vanquish your monster? Is it able to be defeated? Does it hate daylight? Giving your monster its own rules and limits can help establish a believable creature. However, lacking a weakness can also be part of your monster’s horror as well.

        `5 Examples of Monsters in Literature
        `,
        `Monsters can be science fiction creations with gaping maws and poisonous fangs, but they can also be like human beings as well, like a rogue android or possessed parent. Below is a list of famous literary, television, and film monsters:
        `,
        `Count Dracula: Infamous vampire from Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897).
        `,
        `Balrogs: Menacing monsters of fire and shadow in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings series (1937).
        `,
        `Mr. Hyde: Evil alter-ego of the character Dr. Jekyll, from Robert Louis Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886).

        `How to Write a Monster
        `,
        `If you’re looking for how to make a monster of your own, there are a few guidelines you can follow to make your new monster feel like a real monster:
        `,
        `Provide a little background. Your monster may not exist in the real world, but it still needs some logical follow-through. Where did it come from? Why does it look the way it does? Is it man-made like Dr. Frankenstein’s monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1823)? Or is it a natural creature like Beowulf’s Grendel? You don’t have to answer every question about your monster in your writing (sometimes the unknown is just as scary), however, the audience should know a little background information to envision a full enough picture.
        `,
        `Leave space for the imagination. Even though you want the audience to get a complete picture of your monstrosity, a person’s own imagination can always be scarier than anything someone else could create, like the Jabberwock from Lewis Carroll’s nonsense poem The Jabberwocky (1871). Leaving room for your reader to fill in the gaps may result in them imagining their own worst personal fears in conjunction with whatever horrors you’ve already laid out.
        `,
        `Give it a name. Personifying a monster draws it a little closer into real-life, and giving something a name makes it feel more tangible. Sometimes the fear of a name lies in its ambiguity, like John Carpenter’s ‘The Thing,’ or it can be a name that feels scary and powerful, like Tomoyuki Tanaka’s ‘Godzilla.’ Or sometimes, it’s the existing name of a horrific mythological villain like ‘Typhon.’
        `,
        `Make it hard to kill. Sometimes a monster is relentless and needs to be physically fought, and sometimes there’s a secret or trick to killing it that is unknown until later on in the story. Monsters that cannot be defeated easily create big moments of tension and anticipation for readers and viewers alike. The harder to kill, the scarier they become.

        body: [`When most people think about fairies, they perhaps picture the sparkling Tinker Bell from Peter Pan or the other heartwarming and cute fairies and fairy god mothers that populate many Disney movies and children’s cartoons. But these creatures have much darker origins - and were once thought to be more like undead blood-sucking vampires.
        `,
        `In The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies (1682), folklorist Robert Kirk argued that fairies are “the dead”, or of “a middle nature betwixt man and angels”. This association is particularly prominent in Celtic lore. Writing in 1887, Lady Jane Wilde popularised the Irish belief that: 
        `,
        `fairies are the fallen angels who were cast down by the Lord God out of heaven for their sinful pride…and the devil gives to these knowledge and power and sends them on earth where they work much evil.
        `,
        `At first sight the current innocent idea of fairyland seems as far away from the shadowy realms of the dead, and yet there are many resemblances between them. Despite their wands and glitter, fairies have a dark history and surprisingly gothic credentials. So why did we lose our fear of fairies and how did they come to be associated with childhood?
        `,
        `How fairies lost their bite
        `,
        `When JM Barrie’s Peter Pan debuted in the early 1900s, it was widely believed in society at that time that fairies were inhabited a shadowy spirit world. Fascinated by angels, ghosts and vampires Victorians (subsequently Edwardians) increasingly saw fairies as the souls of the dead. Rather than dispelling fairies, the first world war and the loss of many loved ones heightened a belief in airy spirits and occult methods of communicating with them.
        `,
        `However, due to Peter Pan’s great success and the prominent “pixie” character of Tinker Bell the creatures would eventually lose their malevolence as they became confined to the nursery.
        `,
        `Barrie famously equated the origin of fairies with children:
        `,
        `When the first baby laughed…its laugh broke into a thousand pieces…that was the beginning of fairies.
        `,
        `This is far from the malevolent fairies and their shadowy history in folklore. In these stories they steal children, drive people insane, blight cattle and crops – and drink human blood. Barrie, of course, was aware of their dark side. Despite the fairy dust and glamour, Tinker Bell is dangerous and vengeful like a deadly fairy temptress. At one point in the story, she even threatens to kill Wendy.
        `,
        `Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up, debuted on stage at Christmas in 1904. It was inspired by performing fairies in popular shows such as Seymour Hicks’s Bluebell in Fairyland. Peter Pan was canonised by Disney in 1953 and the sentimental celluloid fairy was born. The cutesy and youthful fairies of contemporary children’s TV are a result of this Disneyfication.
        `,
        `Blood hungry demons
        `,
        `But in folklore, fairies are often a demonic or undead force; one which humans need to seek protection against. As folklorist Katharine Briggs has noted. In her Dictionary of Fairies, she wrote:
        `,
        `People walking alone by night, especially through fairy-haunted places, had many ways of protecting themselves. The first might be sacred symbols, by making the sign of a cross, or by carrying a cross, particularly one made of iron; by prayers, or the chanting of hymns, by holy water, sprinkled or carried, and by carrying and strewing Churchyard mould in their path. Bread and salt were also effective, and both were regarded as sacred symbols, one of life and the other of eternity.
        `,
        `What is more, fairyland has a hunger for human blood. This links fairies to the vengeful dead and to vampires. In early accounts, vampires are defined as the bodies of the dead, animated by evil spirits, which come out of their graves in the night, suck the blood the living and thereby destroy them – as an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary from 1734 noted .
        `,
        `Diane Purkiss’s history of fairies, includes a Scottish Highland legend which warns that you must bring water into the house at night, so the fairies don’t quench their thirst with your blood. Very old fairies, like vampires, were said to wrinkle and dry up without fresh blood.
        `,
        `The Baobhan Sith are vampiric Scottish fairies. These beautiful green banshees have hooves instead of feet, they dance with and exhaust their male victims then tear them to pieces. Like many fairies, they can be killed with iron.
        `,
        `Dearg-Due are Irish vampiric fairies or “Red Blood Suckers”. They were thought to be influential on Sheridan Le Fanu’s female vampire tale Carmilla (1871).
        `,
        `Halloween is supposedly a time when the veil between our world and the shadow world is extremely thin. A time when you are more likely to hear stories of encounters between humans and fairies. So if this Halloween you go seeking winged friends, a warning to the curious, they might not be as sweet as you think.
        `,
        `Tread carefully and never enter a fairy ring. Circles of mushrooms, they are believed to have been created by fairies dancing in rounds. According to folklore, if you do happen to step into such a circle of mushrooms, you may become invisible and be made to dance around until you die of exhaustion. So a healthy fear of fairies is always wise.

        body: [`The werewolf is a staple of supernatural fiction, whether it be film, television, or literature. You might think this snarling creature is a creation of the Medieval and Early Modern periods, a result of the superstitions surrounding magic and witchcraft.
        `,
        `In reality, the werewolf is far older than that. The earliest surviving example of man-to-wolf transformation is found in The Epic of Gilgamesh from around 2,100 BC. However, the werewolf as we now know it first appeared in ancient Greece and Rome, in ethnographic, poetic and philosophical texts.
        `,
        `These stories of the transformed beast are usually mythological, although some have a basis in local histories, religions and cults. In 425 BC, Greek historian Herodotus described the Neuri, a nomadic tribe of magical men who changed into wolf shapes for several days of the year. The Neuri were from Scythia, land that is now part of Russia. Using wolf skins for warmth is not outside the realm of possibility for inhabitants of such a harsh climate: this is likely the reason Herodotus described their practice as “transformation”.
        `,
        `The werewolf myth became integrated with the local history of Arcadia, a region of Greece. Here, Zeus was worshipped as Lycaean Zeus (“Wolf Zeus”). In 380 BC, Greek philosopher Plato told a story in the Republic about the “protector-turned-tyrant” of the shrine of Lycaean Zeus. In this short passage, the character Socrates remarks: “The story goes that he who tastes of the one bit of human entrails minced up with those of other victims is inevitably transformed into a wolf.”
        `,
        `Monsters and men
        `,
        `The most interesting aspect of Plato’s passage concerns the “protector-turned-tyrant”, also known as the mythical king, Lycaon. Expanded further in Latin texts, most notably Hyginus’s Fabulae and Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Lycaon’s story contains all the elements of a modern werewolf tale: immoral behaviour, murder and cannibalism.
        `,
        `In Fabulae, the sons of Lycaon sacrificed their youngest brother to prove Zeus’s weakness. They served the corpse as a pseudo-feast and attempting to trick the god into eating it. A furious Zeus slayed the sons with a lightning bolt and transformed their father into a wolf. In Ovid’s version, Lycaon murdered and mutilated a protected hostage of Zeus, but suffered the same consequences.
        `,
        `Ovid’s passage is one of the only ancient sources that goes into detail on the act of transformation. His description of the metamorphosis uses haunting language that creates a correlation between Lycaon’s behaviour and the physical manipulation of his body:
        `,
        `…He tried to speak, but his voice broke into
        `,
        `an echoing howl. His ravening soul infected his jaws;
        `,
        `his murderous longings were turned on the cattle; he still was possessed
        `,
        `by bloodlust. His garments were changed to a shaggy coat and his arms
        `,
        `into legs. He was now transformed into a wolf.
        `,
        `Ovid’s Lycaon is the origin of the modern werewolf, as the physical manipulation of his body hinges on his prior immoral behaviour. It is this that has contributed to the establishment of the “monstrous werewolf” trope of modern fiction.
        `,
        `Lycaon’s character defects are physically grafted onto his body, manipulating his human form until he becomes that which his behaviour suggests. And, perhaps most importantly, Lycaon begins the idea that to transform into a werewolf you must first be a monster.
        `,
        `The idea that there was a link between biology (i.e. appearance) and “immoral” behaviour developed fully in the late 20th century. However, minority groups were more often the target than mythical kings. Law enforcement, scientists and the medical community joined forces to find “cures” for socially deviant behaviour such as criminality, violence and even homosexuality. Science and medicine were used as a vehicle through which bigotry and fear could be maintained, as shown by the treatment of HIV-affected men throughout the 1980s.
        `,
        `However, werewolf stories show the idea has ancient origins. For as long as authors have been changing bad men into wolves, we have been looking for the biological link between man and action.

        `World War Z, The Twilight Saga, The Walking Dead, True Blood, the White Walkers from Game of Thrones — our current obsession with monsters seems to be at an all-time high as we binge on hit movies and TV series dedicated to vampires and zombies. In today’s youth-obsessed culture in which we are reluctant to even acknowledge our own mortality, much less discuss it, does this fascination with monsters signal a need to confront our fear of death?

        `First, there is nothing new in our love of monsters, according to Leo Braudy, University Professor and holder of the Leo S. Bing Chair in English and American Literature. “We have told each other scary stories since the beginning of time. Ghosts, for instance, have been around since the start of civilization,” he said.

        `,
        `Recognizing the four categories of monsters
        `,
        `In Haunted, Braudy divides monsters into four categories. First, “the monster from nature” embodies our fear of an uncontrollable natural world. Examples fall into two groups: mysterious, elusive but ultimately less threatening monsters like Sasquatch, the Yeti or the Loch Ness Monster; and more menacing specimens, like Godzilla or King Kong, that embody the fear that nature will take her revenge for our transgressions against her.
        `,
        `The second type of monster is associated with the fear of science. Frankenstein is an example of this kind of monster, created purposefully by a scientist whose hubris leads him to believe he can rival God’s creativity to bring to life an unprecedented being.
        `,
        `Third, the Jekyll and Hyde monster. Appearing in the late 1880s, it is one of several doppelganger figures — people with double lives or double selves — that reflects the more complex, late Victorian view of human psychology. This is rendered not necessarily in terms of Freudian psychoanalysis or depth psychology, but in terms of fears of the monstrousness of one’s otherwise repressed self. This psychological monster-from-within nevertheless coincides with Freud’s early development of his theories of psychology and the inner self.
        `,
        `Finally, there is the monster from the past that arrives to take revenge on us and our modern cult of progress, improvement and change.
        `,
        `“Dracula, who comes out of a very distant, even pre-Christian past, is a prime example,” Braudy noted. “He promises immortality.”
        `,
        `Vampires and zombies
        `,
        `Our modern-day enthusiasm for vampires stems from our desire to avoid confronting our own mortality, Braudy believes.
        `,
        `Vampires … represent, for the moment, a liberation from mortality.
        `,
        `Leo Braudy
        `,
        `“Vampires have lived for thousands of years, have survived history, so they are simultaneously feared but admired, because they represent, for the moment, a liberation from mortality.”
        `,
        `On the other hand, the current zombie craze, Braudy argues, reflects our present-day fear of groups. This is an era where we’re less afraid of James Bond-type villains — those descendants of Hitler and Mussolini who want to rule the world — and more afraid of the faceless, shadowy, anonymous groups we can’t pin down.
        `,
        `“What’s really different about the zombie and what separates it from most of the classic monsters is that it’s part of a collective, while other monsters are individuals,” Braudy said. “There’s no hierarchy in the zombie world, no ‘king zombie,’ so fear of zombies represents a modern fear of groups. They might be Islamic fundamentalists, immigrants, Republicans, Democrats — you name it, whatever group frightens you.”
        `,
        `A revealing obsession
        `,
        `Our love of monsters is revealing, Braudy argued, showing us how preoccupied we are with death and mortality. Our obsession with monsters provides the counterbalance to our own change in funerary practices as described in Jessica Mitford’s celebrated book The American Way of Death — medicalized, sanitized death that now takes place mostly in hospitals, far removed from our daily lives.
        `,
        `“What horror does,” Braudy said, “is keep our mortality squarely in front of us.”
        `,
        `Popular culture, he argued, essentially allows us to indulge our fears and desires without penalty, and that explains the pleasure we currently derive from watching films or TV shows featuring monsters, including zombies and vampires.
        `,
        `“Popular culture is, to a certain extent, emotionally compensatory,” Braudy said. “It allows us to indulge those fears and desires that medical science has deprived us of by de-sentimentalizing or de-emotionalizing death.”
        `,
        `“Scary monsters, super creeps / keep me running, running scared,” David Bowie sang on his hit from the 1980 album Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps). His words still ring true today and, according to Braudy, will likely continue to do so for generations to come. “Our fascination with monsters,” Braudy said, “is perpetual.”

        `But a Rolling Stone article about our “age of fear” notes that most Americans are living “in the safest place at the safest time in human history.”
        `,
        `It continues:
        `,
        `Around the globe, household wealth, longevity and education are on the rise, while violent crime and extreme poverty are down. In the U.S., life expectancy is higher than ever, our air is the cleanest it’s been in a decade and, despite a slight uptick last year, violent crime has been trending down since 1991.
        `,
        `So why are we still so afraid?
        `,
        `Emerging technology and media could play a role. But in a sense, these have always played a role.
        `,
        `In the past, rumor and a rudimentary press coverage could fan the fires. Now, with the rise of social media, fears and fads and fancies race instantly through entire populations. Sometimes the specifics vanish almost as quickly as they arose, but the addiction to sensation, to fear and fantasy, persists, like a low-grade fever.
        `,
        `People often create symbols for that emotions are fleeting, abstract, and hard to describe. (Look no further than the recent rise of the emoji.)
        `,
        `For over the last three centuries, Europeans and Americans, in particular, have shaped anxiety and paranoia into the mythic figure of the monster – the embodiment of fear, disorder and abnormality – a history that I detail in my new book, “Haunted.”
        `,
        `There are four main types of monsters. But a fifth – a nameless one – may best represent the anxieties of the 21st century.
        `,
        `Rejecting rationality
        `,
        `The 1700s and 1800s were an era of revolutionary uprisings that trumpeted a limitless future, when the philosophers and scientists of the Enlightenment proclaimed that reason had the power to change the world. Emotion was pushed out of the intellectual sphere by scientific reasoning; awestruck spirituality had been repressed in favor of the Clockmaker God who set the universal laws into motion.
        `,
        `Of course, humans have always been afraid. But while the fears of the demonic and the diabolical characterized medieval times, the changes wrought by the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution created a whole new set of fears tied to advancements in science and technology, and an increasingly crowded and complex world.
        `,
        `During this age of political upheavals and aggressive modernization, tales of Gothic horror, haunted castles, secret compartments and rotting corpses were the rage. The novels and stories of writers such as Horace Walpole, Matthew G. Lewis, Anne Radcliffe and Mary Shelley soon became bestsellers. These writers – and many others – tapped into something pervasive, giving names and bodies to a universal emotion: fear.
        `,
        `The fictional monsters created during this period can be categorized into four types. Each corresponds to a deep seated anxiety about progress, the future and the human ability to achieve anything like control over the world.
        `,
        `“The monster from nature” represents a power that humans only think they have harnessed, but haven’t. The Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, King Kong and Godzilla are all examples of this type. An awesome abnormality that we can’t predict and scramble to understand, it strikes without warning – like the shark in “Jaws.” While the obvious inspiration are real ferocious animals, they could also be thought of as embodied versions of natural disasters – hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis.
        `,
        `“The created monster,” like Dr. Frankenstein’s monster, is the monster we have built and believe we can control – until it turns against us. His descendants are the robots, androids and cyborgs of today, with their potential to become all too human – and threatening.
        `,
        `“The monster from within” is the monster generated by our own repressed dark psychology, the other side of our otherwise bland and blameless human nature (think the Mr. Hyde to our Dr. Jekyll). When nondescript and seemingly harmless young men turn into mass-murdering killers or suicide bombers, the “monster from within” has shown his face.
        `,
        `“The monster from the past,” like Dracula, comes out of a pagan world and offers an alternative to ordinary Christianity with his promise of a blood feast that will confer immortality. Like a Nietzschean superman, he represents the fear that the ordinary consolations of religion are bankrupt and that the only answer to the chaos of modern life is the securing of power.
        `,
        `Zombies: A vague, nameless danger
        `,
        `Recently, our culture has become fixated on the zombie. The recent explosion of zombie films and stories illustrates how fear – while it may be a basic human trait – assumes the shape of particular eras and cultures.
        `,
        `The zombie emerged from the brutal Caribbean slave plantations of the 17th and 18th centuries. They were the soulless bodies of undead slaves who stalked plantations grounds – so the myth went. But director George Romero’s pioneering films, like “Dawn of the Dead” (1978), generalized the figure into an unthinking member of a mass consumer society.
        `,
        `The central distinction between the traditional monsters – such as the Frankenstein monster, Dracula or Mr. Hyde – is that the zombie exists primarily as part of a group. Unlike earlier monsters, who all stand alone, even in a kind of grandeur, one zombie is barely distinguishable from another.
        `,
        `What might the horrific image of mindless hordes out to eat our brains represent in the 21st century? It could symbolize whatever we fear will overwhelm and engulf us: epidemic disease, globalization, Islamic fundamentalists, illegal immigrants and refugees. Or it could be something less tangible and more existential: the loss of anonymity and individuality in a complex world, the threat of impersonal technology that makes each of us just another number in an electronic list.
        `,
        `In 1918, German sociologist Max Weber announced the triumph of reason: “There are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play,” he wrote in “Science as a Vocation.” “One can, in principle, master all things by calculation.”
        `,
        `“The world,” he continued, “is disenchanted.”
        `,
        `Weber may have been a bit optimistic. Yes, we are committed, in many ways, to reason and analytic thinking. But it seems that we need our monsters and our sense of enchantment as well.

        Whether they exist in nature or in our minds, monsters remind us of our place in the world. Some of these creatures distance themselves from civilization, whereas others lurk nearby. For years, films have given shape to our fear of the unnatural. Xenomorphs changed how we think of aliens. David Cronenberg's The Fly showed how we make our own monsters. And dinosaurs were no longer a fantasy in Jurassic Park. But for every successful-looking monster, there are ones who undermine their own fearfulness. With a focus on the '90s, here are ten monsters that looked too hilarious to be scary.
        `,
        `
        10. Watchers II: The Monster`,
        `
        Dean Koontz's novel Watchers spawned a 1988 film of the same name. In the movie's first sequel, another mutated beast is in hot pursuit of a genius golden retriever. Watchers II was made on an even smaller budget than its predecessor. This means the monster looks worse. Dreadful, in all honesty. It's hard to accurately describe what he looks like, but imagine a life-sized anteater made of wax. Then leave him under a low-heat lamp for a few hours. The mediocre costume design absolutely hampers the monster's scare factor in Watchers II. Not that the first movie's was much better.
        `,
        `
        9. Tremors 2 — Aftershocks: Shriekers`,
        `
        The Graboids in the Tremors franchise are giant, carnivorous sandworms. And thanks to Amalgamated Dynamics, these animatronic invertebrates look pretty good for the era. It's in the sequels, however, where things look dicey. The Graboids apparently evolve like Pokémon — in the 1996 sequel Tremors 2: Aftershocks, the worms abandon the subterranean lifestyle. Their second life cycle stage is the Shrieker, a terrestrial and limbless critter with a built-in heat sensor. A Shrieker is tougher to contend with than a Graboid, but it looks like a mutated, featherless turkey. You'll run from them, yet you'll feel silly for doing so.
        `,
        `
        8. Guyver: The Zoanoids`,
        `
        Based on the manga of the same name, The Guyver is an underrated actioner. In the film, a martial artist becomes the titular hero after coming into contact with an alien artifact called the Unit. He and his love interest are eventually hunted down by a corporation — consisting of monsters called Zoanoids — seeking out the device. With its relatively small budget, The Guyver did an honorable job with the special effects and costumes. That being said, the Zoanoids lack their manga counterparts' menacing miens. They also bear a striking resemblance to the creature designs in Gremlins 2: The New Batch.
        `,
        `
        7. Anaconda: The Anaconda`,
        `
        When making the sequel to Anaconda — Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid — production gave the snakes a facelift. They found that real anacondas had silly-looking heads. Or as stated on the DVD for Blood Orchid — "bizarre and comical." There is merit to their reasoning. Looking closely, there is something quite off about an anaconda's face. It might be the eyes. The Jennifer Lopez movie from 1997 overstated the snake's facade. Every time the anaconda gapes its mouth, it looks like it's laughing. And in turn, the viewers laugh, too.
        `,
        `
        6. Godzilla 2000: Orga`,
        `
        Orga is one Godzilla-verse foe who doesn't get talked about enough. And there's a reason why. In Toho's 1999 entry in the long-running franchise, defending Japan from Godzilla is now a top priority. Godzilla 2000 features a race of aliens looking to clone the enormous titular beast. With only a sample of DNA, the aliens merge and become a kaiju called Orga. Orga's head resembling that of TriStar's Godzilla is deliberate, by the way. This monster disappoints because it's a lumbering, muddled mess. Orga frankly better suits an '80s Alien ripoff than a Godzilla movie. There is just nothing artful about Orga's design.
        `,
        `
        5. An American Werewolf In Paris: The Werewolves`,
        `
        John Landis' classic An American Werewolf in London boasts some astounding special effects. Everything was hands-on and tangible. But the same can't be said for its 1997 sequel, An American Werewolf in Paris. This being the nineties, there was a growing shift in movies laden with CGI. That's not to say computer-aided visuals are outright bad. In the right hands, they can surely wow. The problem here is the werewolves are so artificial-looking. Audiences know what a traditional werewolf should look like, and this is not it. Rather, these wolves look like they'd be more comfortable in a PS1 RPG.
        `,
        `
        4. The Boneyard: The Poodle`,
        `
        You wouldn't think a demonic poodle would be scary. And you're right, it's definitely not. Alas, The Boneyard gives us a very big one. In this 1991 straight-to-video horror, a mortuary becomes the battleground between good and evil. Three mummified bodies brought there turn out to be ancient demons who can only be sated with human flesh. Unfortunately for the film's characters, one of the demons possesses an innocent poodle. The result is so ludicrous that one of the actors cracks up at the sight. Nevertheless, The Boneyard is a fun time because it doesn't take itself all that seriously.
        `,
        `
        3. Troll II: The Goblins`,
        `
        Troll II is one of those movies whose reputation precedes it. Everyone knows it's awful, and no one expects it to be frightening. People celebrate its atrociousness. For those who haven't experienced this movie, Troll II follows a family who's moved into a town called Nilbog. As it turns out, Nilbog is full of goblins (not trolls). The weird thing about these goblins is they're vegetarians. Yet they want to turn the family into vegetables so they can eat them. The goblins themselves are the complete opposite of intimidating. They merely amble about in their costumes and masks, which looks like they were purchased at a discount Halloween store.
        `,
        `
        2. Stephen King's It: The Spider`,
        `
        Tim Curry gave a memorable performance as the eponymous creature in Stephen King's It. In the miniseries' conclusion, however, It — or Pennywise — takes on the form of a spider-like monster. Remembering that the 1990 adaptation of Stephen King's novel was made for television, one has to forgive the so-so visual effects. The creature moves in the most ungainly manner, and when one examines its face more closely, they'll see what looks like a starfish with eyes. The standoff between It and the Losers' Club should be tense. Instead, any potential for dread has been sapped by a giant, goofy spider.
        `,
        `
        1. Sleepwalkers: The Werecats`,
        `
        In Stephen King's Sleepwalkers, a teenager gets involved with a pair of shapeshifting werecats. A mother and her son, to be exact. These day-walking energy vampires specifically feed on virginal humans. And for some odd reason, they have a major aversion to actual cats. Although the story isn't all that impressive, the main problem with this original Stephen King movie is the visual effects. The cat monsters' transformations are achieved through morphing. Think Michael Jackson's "Black or White" music video. While it may have seemed advanced in 1992, the antagonists look dated now when transitioning from human to werecat.
